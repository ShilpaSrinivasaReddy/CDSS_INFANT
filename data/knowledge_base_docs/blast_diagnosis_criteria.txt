Title: Morphological and Imaging Criteria for Blast Identification in Peripheral Blood Smear

Blast cells are immature precursors typically found in the bone marrow but appear in peripheral blood in leukemia.

Morphological Features of Blasts:
- Large nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio
- Fine chromatin pattern
- Presence of nucleoli (usually 1â€“3 prominent)
- Scant agranular cytoplasm
- Absence of specific granules or Auer rods (in ALL)

Types of Blasts:
- Lymphoblasts (ALL): round nucleus, condensed chromatin, indistinct nucleoli
- Myeloblasts (AML): open chromatin, prominent nucleoli, more cytoplasm, can contain Auer rods

When to Suspect Leukemia from a Blood Smear:
- Blast cells seen in >5% of white blood cells
- Accompanied by pancytopenia or bicytopenia
- Symptoms: fever, fatigue, bruising, infections

Diagnostic Confirmation:
- Flow cytometry to classify the blasts
- Bone marrow biopsy to quantify and confirm lineage
- Genetic markers such as t(8;21), t(15;17), or MLL rearrangements

AI imaging models may assist in the identification of blast-like cells in digital smear images, but clinical confirmation is required.
