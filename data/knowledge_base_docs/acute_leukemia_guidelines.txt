Title: Diagnostic Guidelines for Acute Leukemia in Children

Acute leukemia is characterized by the rapid proliferation of immature blood cells. The two main types are Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

Diagnosis Criteria for ALL:
- Complete Blood Count (CBC) often shows anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis or leukopenia.
- Peripheral blood smear may reveal blasts.
- Bone marrow examination is mandatory; diagnosis is confirmed when blast percentage is >25%.
- Immunophenotyping is used to confirm lineage (e.g., B-cell, T-cell).
- Cytogenetic analysis helps identify prognostic markers such as t(12;21), t(9;22), and hyperdiploidy.

Clinical Features:
- Fever, fatigue, pallor, bruising, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly.
- Central nervous system involvement can cause headaches, vomiting, and cranial nerve palsies.

Initial Work-up:
- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
- Lumbar puncture to assess CNS involvement
- Coagulation profile, liver and renal function tests
- Genetic tests for chromosomal abnormalities and gene fusions (e.g., ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL1)

Early identification of subtype and risk stratification is essential for effective treatment planning.
