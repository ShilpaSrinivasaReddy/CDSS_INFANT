Title: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Protocols and Response-Based Risk Stratification

Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a key prognostic factor in pediatric leukemia and guides therapeutic decisions.

Standard MRD Time Points:
- Day 15 (Early Response)
- Day 29 or 33 (End of Induction)
- Week 12 (Consolidation Phase)

Interpretation of MRD Levels (by flow cytometry or PCR):
- MRD < 0.01% = Good response
- MRD 0.01–0.1% = Intermediate
- MRD > 0.1% = Poor response, consider intensification

Day 29 MRD Implications:
- If MRD > 0.01% on Day 29: shift patient to High-Risk arm of treatment protocol.
- MRD > 1% indicates extremely poor prognosis — refer for transplant evaluation.

Therapy Adjustment Based on MRD:
- Good responders may reduce chemotherapy intensity
- Poor responders require intensification or addition of targeted therapies such as blinatumomab or CAR-T cell therapy

The MRD assessment must always be interpreted in the context of other genetic and clinical risk factors.
